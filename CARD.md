# Community is the most fantastic thing in an open-source project. 
Hello, and thank you for contributing to this project. ðŸ‘‹ We'll welcome your PRs, issues, and comments. But we don't want to work together with villains.
**"Once, Twice can be a mistake, but over three times, we should consider your qualification."** 
That's our rule, and I hope you make sure of this sentence. Now, I will tell you the most dangerous part of the punishment, ***the card***.

# What Is Card?
You may hear about the card system in soccer. The card system has two kinds of punishment, *'Yellow Card'* and **'Red Card.'**

## Kind of Card
- **Yellow Card** Yellow card is a warning card. If you harm others in the community, you can get this card with DiggieBro Team's judge.
- **Red Card**: **You can punish Red Card when you do very harmful actions in the community** or harm others **continuously**. We'll give you a red card if you
        **get more than three yellow cards**. Also, we will open **a discussion about your red card**. If you **contributed a lot**
        or **reflect on your action**, we can overturn our judge. But, if you did *harmful activities **(LEVEL CRITICAL)***,
        we will ban you. I hope you don't do it.
