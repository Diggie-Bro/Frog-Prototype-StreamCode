# Community is the most important thing in open-source project.

Hello, and thank you for contributing this project. ðŸ‘‹
We'll welcome your PRs, issues, and comments. But we don't want to work together with villains.
**"Once, Twice can be mistake, but over three times, we should consider your qualification."** 
That's our overall rule, and I hope you remember this sentence. 
Now, I will tell you the most dangerous part of punishment, ***Card***.

# What Is Card?
If you know soccer, you may know card system. Card system has two kind of punishment, *'Yellow Card'* and **'Red Card'**.

## Kind of Card
- **Yellow Card** Yellow card is warning card. If you harm others in community, you can get this card with *DiggieBro Team*'s judge.
- **Red Card**: **You can get Red Card when you do very harmful action in community**, or harm others **continuously**. We'll give you red card if you
        **get more than three yellow cards**. Also, we will open **discussion about your red card**. If you **contributed a lot**
        or **reflect your action**, we can overturn our judge. But, if you did *very serious action **(LEVEL CRITICAL)***,
        we will ban you. I hope you don't do it.i
