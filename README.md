About StreamCode
---

### `A >> B >> C`
This is our basic form of StreamCode. `A` is input process of stream. `B` is filter, and `C` is output process.   
Stream should include at lease two process. The stream will be run following LTR(Left To Right) rule.

### `[return]::A >> [param]:B`
`A` should return value to pipeline, so you can return value in [return] as writing variable name.   
Also, `B` should load data from pipeline, so you can make parameter in [param] as writing variable name.
*Rember, form of `[return]` should correspond with `[param]`*

> #### example
> ```
> name::name = run input("What's your name?") >> name:run print("Hello, " + name)
> ```

#### We're developing more grammar. Stay tuned ;)
