You can report a bug by the issue template. I recommend using the issue tag `bug`. Your report should have an error log and before and after errors.

You can suggest a new feature by the issue template. In this case, use the issue tag 'HowAboutThat'. Your report should have detail and reason.

## Pull Request
PR is very easy! Just attach a suitable tag, and open it! We are welcome your PR to satisfy all checklists.

# Checklist
## Pull Request Checklist
We think Pull Requests is the best way to contribute. Here are some tips to be accepted.

- Does PR(same with issue) have a suitable tag 
- Is that an **available** code? (if we think this code is unstable, the review can be longer)
- Is code consistent with Standard Coding Style?
- Does code have reasons to change?
- code consists of only English without *translate* tag? (we will reject all your translation version without this tag)

How can you check your PR is available? Just try it! With the tag *Confused*, Our team will attach the reason for rejection and tips.
Your PR will depend on this guideline. If your PR was rejected, Check this guideline before contact with our team.
**When you contact us, make a new issue with tag *RE*.**

## Issue Checklist
Making issues is the fastest way to fix errors or give feedback. Here is your checklist.

CRITICAL - Does your issues related to sex, violence, racism, religion, or commerce?  
WARNING - Does your issues out of the subject?  
WARNING - Does your issues harm the community's decisions?  
INFO - Is your issue duplicated?  

- **If you violate the LEVEL CRITICAL checklist, you can get Red Card. *No back*. Your account will be ban.**
- If you violate the LEVEL WARNING checklist, you can get Yellow Card. This yellow card means you should consider more. 
Three yellow cards can change to **RED CARD** after final checking. Your yellow card removes after one month.
- LEVEL Info won't affect your condition.
